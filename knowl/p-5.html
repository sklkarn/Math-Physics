<div class="para">In order to describe a physical world we need a variety of physical quantities. Any physical property which can be quantitized and measured in numbers is called a physical quantity. The property such as â€™anger, happiness, feelings, emotion, etc. can not be quantitized and measured, hence they are not taken as physical quantities. There are two types of physical quantities usually consider to describe a physical world. They are a scalar quantity (or, simply  scalars) and a vector quantity (or, simply vectors) A scalar quantity has only magnitude (size)  e.g., mass, length, time, volume, density, work, speed, temperature, potential, current, resistance, flux, power, intensity, etc. A vector quantity has both magnitude and direction e.g., velocity, acceleration, displacement, momentum, force, torque, impulse, moment, current density, etc. A quantity like surface area is a scalar in general, but when considered with its specific orientation it is taken as a vector. In physics, area is a vector quantity whose direction is always taken as an outward normal to the surface. Normally, when area comes with any vectors in a mathematical operation it is considered as a vector. For instance, flux is a dot product of two vectors, one of them is an area. Mathematically, division of a vector with another vector is undefined, hence pressure is considered as a scalar even if it is defined as a force per unit area. To define pressure in general as a scalar we divide a magnitude of the normal component of the force to the magnitude of the area. Actually, pressure has more than one direction, hence it is a complex quantity which comes under tensors. The concept of tensors are not made known in elementary courses.  A tensor is a vector generalization of physical quantities. (We will discuss tensors later in this book.)</div>
