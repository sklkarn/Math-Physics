<div class="para">A vector which specifies the position of point P with respect to its origin O is called a position vector, as shown in  <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-vectora.html" title="Figure 1.0.1.(a)">Figure 1.0.1.(a)</a>. Let P and Q be two points and O be the point of origin then the position vector of point P is <span class="process-math">\(\vec{OP}\)</span> and that of point Q is <span class="process-math">\(\vec{OQ}\text{,}\)</span> as shown in  <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-vectorb.html" title="Figure 1.0.1.(b)">Figure 1.0.1.(b)</a>. A vector of zero magnitude is a null vector. It is denoted by <span class="process-math">\(\vec{O}\text{.}\)</span>  The initial and terminal points coincide in case of a null vector. Thus it has no definite direction. The vectors with same magnitude but in opposite direction are termed as negative vectors. Vectors having the same direction are called like vectors, whereas those having opposite directions are called  unlike vectors. The vectors parallel to the same line regardless of their magnitudes and directions are  called collinear vectors. In  this case, there exists a scalar <span class="process-math">\(\lambda \)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(\vec{b} =\lambda \vec{a}\)</span> in the collinear vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vec{a}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{b}\text{.}\)</span> The vectors whose directions are not parallel to each other are non-collinear vectors. A system of vectors lying in the parallel planes or in the same plane are called  coplanar vectors. The system of vectors which can not lie in the same plane or parallel planes are called  non-coplanar vectors.</div>
