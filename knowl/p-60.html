<div class="para">Consider a small rectangular plane area in a region of a non-lamellar vector field. A field is called a <dfn class="terminology">non-lamellar</dfn> if its line integral around a cloased path is non-zero. When the rectangular area is placed in the position ABCD, i.e. perpendicular  to  the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}\)</span> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-fig14a.html" title="Figure 1.2.3.(a)">FigureÂ 1.2.3.(a)</a>, then the field is normal to  each  side of  the rectangle and  hence the line integral  along  all  sides is zero. In  the position of <span class="process-math">\(A_{o}B_{o}C_{o}D_{o}\text{,}\)</span> rectangle is parallel to the field and the line integrals along <span class="process-math">\(B_{o}C_{o}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D_{o}A_{o}\)</span>  are zero while that along <span class="process-math">\(A_{o}B_{o}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C_{o}D_{o}\)</span> have finite  values. Thus the line integral around the boundary of the rectangle has a finite value. The value of a vector field along the upper and lower edges is assumed to be different in non-lamellar vector fields, the value of the line integral around a closed path depends upon the orientation of the small area considered in the region of the vector field. There is a certain orientation of the plane area for which the line integral of the vector field is maximum. This maximum line integral when computed for unit area is called the curl of the vector field. It is a vector quantity directed along the normal to the exploring area. The normal is determined by the right-hand screw rule. Actually, curl is a measurement of the circulation of vector field around a point. If a component of vector field is tangentail to the contour, then the curl will be positive; if the component is opposite to the tangential direction of the contour, then the curl will be negative; and curl is zero at the center point of contour.</div>
