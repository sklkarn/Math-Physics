<div class="para">Eigenvectors help understand linear transformations easily. There are directions along which a linear transformation acts simply by <em class="emphasis">stretching/compressing</em> and/or <em class="emphasis">flipping</em>; eigenvalues give the factors by which this compression occurs. Consider a matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> undergoing a physical transformation (e.g rotation). When this matrix is used to transform a given vector <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> the result is <span class="process-math">\(Y=AX\text{.}\)</span> Now ask a question: Are there any vectors <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> which does not change their direction under this transformation, but allow the vector magnitude to vary by scalar <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\text{?}\)</span> Such a question is of the form <span class="process-math">\(AX=\lambda X\)</span> So, such special <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> are called eigenvector(s) and the change in magnitude depends on the eigenvalue <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\text{.}\)</span> Eigenvalues characterize important aspect of linear transformations, such as whether a system of linear equations has a unique solution or not. In many applications eigenvalues also describe physical propereties of a mathematical model. In Quantum Mechanics, the <em class="emphasis">eigenvectors</em> of operators which corresponds to observable quantities, like energy, position, etc., form a complete basis for the space of all possible states of the system that youâ€™re analysing. That is, any state you want can be written as a linear combination of these <em class="emphasis">eigenvectors</em>. Naturally, this makes to solve problems much easier, all we need is to find the coefficients in this linear combination for which there is a neat formula.</div>
