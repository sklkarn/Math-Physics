<div class="para">If the dependent variable (say, y) and its derivatives appeared in the differential equation are of the first degree then the differential equation is known as linear differential equation, e.g., <span class="process-math">\(x\frac{dy}{dx}+y =e^{x}\)</span> is a linear differential equation of <span class="process-math">\(1^{st}\)</span> order and <span class="process-math">\(1^{st}\)</span> degree. The differential equation is non-linear if it contains the product of dependent variable and its derivative or higher power of dependent variable or its derivative, e.g., <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dy}{dx}+xy^{2} =1\)</span> is a non-linear differential equation as it contains <span class="process-math">\(y^{2}\text{.}\)</span>
