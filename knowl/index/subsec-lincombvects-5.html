<div class="para">Thus <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vectors are linearly dependent, if any one of them can be expressed as a linear combination of the remaining (n-1) vectors. The vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v_{1}},\vec{v_{2}},\vec{v_{3}}, 
\cdots,\vec{v_{n}}\)</span> of equation <a href="subsec-lincombvects.html#eqn-lincombvec1" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/eqn-lincombvec1.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Equation 1.1.5">(1.1.5)</a> form a base or basis for all the vectors in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> - space. Hence these vectors are called the <dfn class="terminology">Basis Vectors</dfn>,  i.e., any vectors lying in the given space can be expressed in terms of these basis vectors <em class="emphasis">basis vectors</em>. For example, suppose <span class="process-math">\(\vec{A}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vec{B}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{C}\)</span> are any three non-zero and non-parallel vectors, and there exists the scalars  <span class="process-math">\(l\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(\vec{D} = l\vec{A}+m\vec{B}+n\vec{C}\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\vec{D}\)</span> is a linear combination of vectors<span class="process-math">\(\vec{A}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vec{B}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{C}\)</span> in three dimensional space. Where <span class="process-math">\(l\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> are components of a <span class="process-math">\(\vec{D}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{A}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vec{B}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{C}\)</span> form the basis vectors. In space (or plane) it is advantageous to choose the basis for the vectors as perpendicular vector each of unit length. These vectors are denoted by <span class="process-math">\(\vec{i}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vec{j}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{k}\)</span> and their common foot by <span class="process-math">\(O\text{.}\)</span> The lines determined by <span class="process-math">\(\vec{i}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vec{j}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{k}\)</span> are the <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axes, respectively. Any  vector <span class="process-math">\(\vec{r}\)</span> in a space with foot at O, as shown in <a href="subsec-lincombvects.html#fig-bvec" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-bvec.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 1.1.4">FigureÂ 1.1.4</a>, can  be expressed as  a  linear combination of the basis vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vec{i}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vec{j}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{k}\text{,}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(\vec{r}= x\vec{i}+y\vec{j}+z\vec{k}\text{.}\)</span> .</div>
