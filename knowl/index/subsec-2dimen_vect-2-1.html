<div class="para">A vector space is said to be an <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>- dimensional if it contains <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> linearly independent vectors. A vector space is called an infinite - dimensional if there exists an arbitrary large number of linearly independent vectors in the space. If an arbitrary vector <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(V_{n}\)</span> can be represented as a linear combination of vectors <span class="process-math">\(\left\{\psi_{i}\right\}\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(V_{n}\)</span> and scalars <span class="process-math">\(\left\{\alpha_{i}\right\}\text{,}\)</span> \i.e.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\phi=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_{i}\psi_{i}  =\alpha_{1}\psi_{1}+\alpha_{2}\psi_{2}+\alpha_{3}\psi_{3}+\cdots+\alpha_{n}\psi_{n}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">then  <span class="process-math">\(\left\{\psi_{i}\right\}\)</span> is said to be a <em class="emphasis">span</em> of the vector space <span class="process-math">\(V_{n}\text{.}\)</span> A linearly independent set of vectors <span class="process-math">\(\left\{\psi_{i}\right\}\)</span> that spans a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V_{n}\)</span> is called a  <em class="emphasis">basis</em> for <span class="process-math">\(V_{n}\text{.}\)</span> For example, the unit vectors <span class="process-math">\(i{,}j{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> of a position vector <span class="process-math">\('r'\)</span> are the basis for the three -  dimensional vector space. The three mutually perpendicular vectors forms an orthogonal basis for a three - dimensional vector space. In other words, if the scalar product of two vectors is zero, the vectors are said to be an orthogonal to each other. The orthogonal bases  of unit magnitude such as <span class="process-math">\(\hat{i} {,} \hat{j}{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\hat{k}\)</span> forms a normal orthogonal basis, called an orthonormal basis. A scalar has one component (magnitude only) and hence zero basis vector per component, A vector has 3 components (magnitude and one direction) in 3D and hence has 1 basis vector per component. A tensor of rank 2 (dyad) has <span class="process-math">\(3^{2} = 9\)</span> components (magnitude and two directions) in 3D hence has 2 basis vectors per component. A tensor of rank 3 (triad) has <span class="process-math">\(3^{3} = 27\)</span> components (magnitude and three directions) in 3D hence has 3 basis vectors per component.</div>
