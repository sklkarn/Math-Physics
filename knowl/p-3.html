<div class="para">Mathematical Physics is a branch of physics which provides the logical relationship between physical theories and mathematical equations. It is based on the concept that everything in nature follows mathematical rules and regulations. Many discoveries such as the existance of positrons, the Higgs Boson, the concept that the gravity is a result of warping of spacetime due to presence of mass, and spacetime obeyes fluid dynamics were possible because of mathematical equations. This book attempts to provide preliminary mathematical concepts to understand physical theories. This book has been written to introduce basic mathematical tools that are useful in undergraduate physics courses and is a concise form of my lecture notes which I have been delivering in bachelors level classes for many years. It attempts to bridge physical theories to mathematical equations. This book is organized into seven chapters that cover the syllabus of mathematical physics at undergraduate level in variuos universities. The book consists of the basics of vectors, vector space, matrix, tensors, Fourier series, integral transforms, and the ordinary &amp; partial differential equations. The main objective of this book is to guide students or readers to understand mathematical equations to learn physics. Many examples and practice problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical intution.</div>
