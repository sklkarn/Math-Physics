<div class="para">Let us consider a thin elastic membrane stretched in xy- plane by a uniform tension T per unit length and A’ B’ C’ D’ be the disturbed position of an element of this membrane from its initial position, as shown in figure <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-fig74.html" title="Figure 7.1.3">Figure 7.1.3</a>. Since the deflection <span class="process-math">\(u(x,y,t)\)</span>  of the membrane and angles of inclination of the tensions are small, the sides of the element A’ B’ C’ D’ are approximately equall to <span class="process-math">\(\delta x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\delta y\text{,}\)</span> the initial lengths of the element. As the membrane is assumed to be perfactly flexible the tensions acting on the membrane are all tangential. If <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\beta\text{,}\)</span> the inclenations of these tensions with the horizontal are small, the components of these forces at the pair of opposite edges B’ C’ and A’ D’ are <span class="process-math">\(T\delta y\cos \alpha\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T\delta y\cos \beta\)</span> are approximately equal and opposite in direction as <span class="process-math">\(\cos \alpha =1 = \cos \beta\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, considering the other pair of edges A’ B’ and C’ D’, we observe that the horizontal components of the forces will be approximately equal and opposite. Thereby we conclude that the motion of the particles of the membrane in horizontal direction is negligibly small, i. e., each particle of the membrane moves vertically. The resultant vertical force on the parallel edges B’ C’ and A’ D’ are</div>
