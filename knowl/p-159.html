<div class="para">In curvilinear co-ordinates, at least one of the coordinate axes is curved and the direction of unit vectors vary with their position. Hence the time derivatives of unit vectors are non-zero. In a <em class="emphasis">Cartesian (rectangular) coordinate system</em>, the coordinate lines are straight and intersect at right angles, but in a <em class="emphasis">curvilinear coordinate system</em>, the coordinate lines are curved and may intersect at oblique angles. Let us consider a coordinate system where the rectangular co-ordinates <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> can be expressed as</div>
