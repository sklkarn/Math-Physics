<div class="para">The one-dimensional heat equation describes the flow of heat in a medium along a single spatial dimension. It is a partial differential equation that relates the rate of change of temperature with respect to time to the second derivative of temperature with respect to the spatial coordinate. The general form of the one-dimensional heat equation is given in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-heat_eqn8.html" title="Equation 7.3.8">(7.3.8)</a>. where <span class="process-math">\(u(x, t)\)</span> represents the temperature at position x and time t, <span class="process-math">\(h^2\)</span> is the thermal diffusivity (a material-specific constant), and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\)</span> denote the partial derivatives with respect to time and space, respectively. This equation describes how the temperature at a given point changes over time due to the heat flow and diffusion within the medium. The second derivative term on the right-hand side accounts for the spatial variations in temperature, while the left-hand side represents the rate of change of temperature with respect to time.</div>
