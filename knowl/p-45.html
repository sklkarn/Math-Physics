<div class="para">A physical quantity which has one or more definite values at each point of a region of space is said to be a point function in that region, and the region in which the physical quantity is defined is called a field. There are two types of point functions, the scalar point function and the vector point function. The physical quantities which are non - directional can be expressed at each point of a region of space by a scalar point function, <span class="process-math">\(\phi\text{.}\)</span> For example, the density of a body and its temperature at any instant of time are scalar point functions, and the region is called a scalar field. If the physical quantities are directional then they can be expressed at each point of a region of space by a vector point function, <span class="process-math">\(\vec{V}\text{,}\)</span> e.g., the velocity of a moving fluid at any instant, the distribution of electric or magnetic field intensity at a point of space are vector point functions, and the region of this space is called a vector field. If <span class="process-math">\(\phi (x,y,z)\)</span> is a scalar function associated with every point <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> of any region in space, then <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span>  is called a scalar point function and the region is defined as a scalar field. Again, if <span class="process-math">\(\vec{V}(x,y,z)\)</span> is a vector associated with every point <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> of any region in space, then <span class="process-math">\(\vec{V}\)</span> is called a vector point function and the region is defined as a vector field. Remember, the gravitational field is a vector field which expresses the value of force, and Higg's field is a scalar field which defines the mass or energy of a particle.</div>
