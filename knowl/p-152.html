<div class="para"> In physics many coordinate systems have been develeoped to solve a problem of particular geometries. We can use a cartesian coordinate system to solve a problem of any kind but finding the solutions of become very tedious. Hence to make things easier some other systems of coordinates such as polar coordinates, cylindrical coordinates, and spherical coordinates are designed. Curvilinear coordinate is used to obtain an easy solution for specific problems, especially when we are solving vector equations. Curvilinear coordinates are useful in many areas of physics and engineering, where problems may be more naturally described in terms of non-Cartesian coordinate systems. For example, the motion of objects in a gravitational field is often more easily described in terms of spherical coordinates, and the behavior of fluids in a pipe may be more easily described in terms of cylindrical coordinates.</div>
