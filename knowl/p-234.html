<div class="para">An orthogonal basis is the best basis for a vector space because the coefficients of which can easily be expressed a vector as a linear combination of basis vectors. However, we are not always given an orthogonal basis. Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is a process used to transform a set of linearly independent vectors into a set of orthonormal vectors, which may not be orthogonal to each other. This process is named after JÃ¸rgen Pedersen Gram and Erhard Schmidt, who independently developed it in the late <span class="process-math">\(19^{th}\)</span> century. Let <span class="process-math">\(u_{1},u_{2},u_{3},\cdots, u_{n}\)</span> be a set of linearly independent vectors which are not necessarily orthogonal to each other. Now, It is required to obtain a set of orthogonal vectors <span class="process-math">\(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},\cdots, v_{n}\)</span> from the original set of vectors <span class="process-math">\(u_{1},u_{2},u_{3},\cdots, u_{n}\)</span> by following the steps below.</div>
