<div class="para">Let us consider a group of students who are measuring the maximum height attained by a projectile or an electric field at a point produced by a charge in a laboratory with their own sets of instrument. Each of them has their own frames of reference orientated in different directions independent of one another. Now if one measures the maximum height of the projectile as 2 meters would it be possible that the others may find it to be 5m, 1m, 10m etc? or if one finds the electric field at a certain point to be 40 N/C and directed eastward, is it likely that another would find it to be 30 N/C and directed southward, and the third would measure it to be 60  N/C and directed upward? Finally, would the height of the projectile or the value of electric field change for individuals just because each of them has distinct coordinate systems? The answer is no because we know that 5 ft person is 5 ft long and it does not matter who and how someone measures it. Thus it is clear that the physical phenomena appear to be the same for all observers stationary relative to each other, independent of the position of each observer, and of the orientation of their frames of refernce.</div>
