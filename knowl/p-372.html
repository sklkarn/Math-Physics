<div class="para">Covariance and contravariance describe how the quantitative description of physical entities change with a change of basis. A covariant tensor is one that transforms in the same way as the coordinate system itself. This means that the components of the tensor change in a particular way when the coordinates of the system are changed. A contravariant tensor, on the other hand, transforms in the opposite way to the coordinate system. This means that the components of the tensor change in a particular way when the coordinates of the system are changed. For a contravariant vector to be basis independent, the components of the vector must contra-vary (opposite manner) with a change of basis to compensate. That is, the components must vary with the inverse transformation to that of the change of basis. These componets of vectors are said to be contravariant. Examples of vectors with contravariant componets include the position of an object (displacement) relative to an observer, or any derivative of position with respect to time including velocity, acceleration, and jerk. For a covariant vector to be basis-independent, the components of the vector must co-vary (same manner) with change of basis to remain representing the same vector. That is, the componets must vary by the same transformation as the change of basis. The componets of these vectors are said to be covariant. Examples of covariant vectors apear when taking a gradiant of a function.</div>
