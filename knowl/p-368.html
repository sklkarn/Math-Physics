<div class="para">Tensor is a convenient tool to establish  relativistic invariance among the laws of nature. It was introduced by G. Ricci and it is used by Einstein to describe a general theory of relativity. Tensor is an entity which is invariant in coordinate transformation. It is a mathematical object that represents a physical quantity which is independent of the choice of coordinate system. Tensors are used to describe many physical phenomena, including the behavior of fluids and gases, the motion of objects under gravity, and the behavior of electromagnetic fields.</div>
