<div class="para">The physical quantites which possess such invarience properties can only be taken into account in the formulation of physical laws. These quantities are scalars, vectors, and in general, tensors. The tensor is useful for describing the properties of substances which vary in directions. It must be noted that a tensor is an entity which is independent of the system of coordinates to which its components are referred. It is only its components which undergo transformation from one coordinate system to another. It is not possible to represent tensors as any geometrical pictures like scalars or vectors, hence tensors can be introduced only through their properties of transformation under coordinate transformations.</div>
