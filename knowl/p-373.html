<div class="para">Tensors are characterized by their rank, which is the number of indices required to specify all of their components. A scalar quantity, such as temperature, is a tensor of rank zero. A vector, such as velocity or force, is a tensor of rank one. A tensor of rank two, such as the stress tensor or the electromagnetic field tensor, requires two indices to specify all of its components. Tensors are important in relativity theory, where the curvature of spacetime is described by a tensor called the Riemann tensor. In quantum field theory, the properties of particles and fields are described by tensors, such as the spin tensor and the polarization tensor.</div>
