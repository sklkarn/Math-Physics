<dfn class="terminology">Laguerre functions:</dfn> are a family of special functions that arise in the solution of certain types of differential equations, specifically the Laguerre's differential equation. The Laguerre functions, denoted as <span class="process-math">\(L_n(x)\text{,}\)</span> are defined as solutions to the following differential equation:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x*y'' + (1 - x)y' + ny = 0
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where y'' represents the second derivative of y with respect to x, y' represents the first derivative of y with respect to x, and n is a parameter that determines the solution. Laguerre functions have several important properties and applications in various areas of mathematics and physics. Some key properties of Laguerre functions include: Orthogonality: Laguerre functions are orthogonal over the interval <span class="process-math">\([0, \infty)\)</span> with respect to the weight function <span class="process-math">\(e^{-x}\text{.}\)</span> Generating function: The Laguerre functions can be generated by the exponential generating function:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
e^{-xt/(1-t)} = \sum (L_n(x)*t^n/n!, \quad n=0 \quad \text{to}\quad \infty)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This generating function allows for convenient manipulations and calculations involving Laguerre functions. Applications: Laguerre functions find applications in various fields, including quantum mechanics, mathematical physics, and probability theory. They are particularly useful in solving problems related to quantum harmonic oscillators, quantum field theory, and the study of atomic and molecular systems. Laguerre functions are just one example of the many special functions that mathematicians and scientists have developed to solve specific types of differential equations and describe various physical phenomena.</div>
