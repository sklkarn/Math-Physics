<em class="alert">Basis Vectors</em> are a set of linearly independent vectors that span a vector space. A vector space can have many different bases, but any two bases of the same vector space have the same number of vectors, which is known as the dimension of the vector space. For example, in two-dimensional space, the standard basis vectors are (1, 0) and (0, 1), which are perpendicular to each other and span the entire space. Any vector in the plane can be written as a linear combination of these two vectors. Similarly, in three-dimensional space, the standard basis vectors are (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1), which are mutually orthogonal and span the entire space. Any vector in three-dimensional space can be expressed as a linear combination of these three vectors.</div>
