<div class="para">In an <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>- dimensional space, the number of components of a tensor of rank <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(n^{r}\text{.}\)</span> For example: A scalar has one component (magnitude only) and hence zero basis vector per component. A vector has two components (magnitude and one direction) in <span class="process-math">\(2D\)</span> and hence has 1 basis vector per component. A vector has 3 components (magnitude and one direction) in 3D and hence has 1 basis vector per component. A tensor of rank 2 (dyad) has <span class="process-math">\(3^{2} = 9\)</span> components (magnitude and two directions) in 3D hence has 2 basis vectors per component. A tensor of rank 3 (triad) has <span class="process-math">\(3^{3} = 27\)</span> components (magnitude and three directions) in 3D hence has 3 basis vectors per component and so on.</div>
