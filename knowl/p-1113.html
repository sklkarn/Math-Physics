<div class="para">PDEs can be classified into different types based on their characteristics. Some common types of PDEs include: <dfn class="terminology">Elliptic PDEs:</dfn>  These equations involve second-order derivatives and typically arise in steady-state problems. Examples include Laplace’s equation and Poisson’s equation. <dfn class="terminology">Parabolic PDEs:</dfn> These equations involve a first-order time derivative and second-order spatial derivatives. They often describe phenomena that evolve over time. The heat equation and the diffusion equation are examples of parabolic PDEs. <dfn class="terminology">Hyperbolic PDEs:</dfn> These equations involve second-order time derivatives and second-order spatial derivatives. They are often used to describe wave-like phenomena. The wave equation and the telegraph equation are examples of hyperbolic PDEs.</div>
