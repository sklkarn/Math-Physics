<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">vector</dfn> is represented by an arrow. The arrow shows the direction of a vector and the length of the arrow represents the magnitude of that vector. Points <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> of an arrow <span class="process-math">\(OP\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-vectora.html" title="Figure 1.0.1.(a)">Figure 1.0.1.(a)</a> are known as the initial point and the terminal point of the vector <span class="process-math">\(\textbf{OP}\text{,}\)</span> respectively. A vector is denoted by a letter with an arrow over it such as <span class="process-math">\(\vec{OP} = \vec{a}\)</span> and its magnitude is denoted by <span class="process-math">\(\vec{|a|}\)</span> or simply by <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> A vector of unit magnitude is called a unit vector and is denoted by <span class="process-math">\(\hat{a}\text{,}\)</span> (’a cap’), Where <span class="process-math">\(\hat{a}=\frac{\vec{a}}{\vec{|a|}}\text{,}\)</span> i.e., <span class="process-math">\(\hat{a}\)</span> is a unit vector of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{a}\text{.}\)</span>
