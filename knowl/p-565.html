<div class="para">If the infinite series solution of a given differential equation is reduced into a finite series, then the solution is called the polynomial. "Polynomial is a finite series that consists of a finite number of terms. Each term in a polynomial is a product of a coefficient, a variable raised to a power, and there is a finite number of such terms in the polynomial expression. The degree of the polynomial determines the highest power of the variable present in the expression, and the number of terms is directly related to the degree".
