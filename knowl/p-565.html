<div class="para">Special functions are specific mathematical functions that arise in the solution of certain types of differential equations. These functions are often defined as solutions to differential equations themselves and have unique properties that make them useful in various branches of mathematics and physics. Some examples of special functions commonly encountered in differential equations include: <dfn class="terminology">Legendre functions:</dfn> Legendre functions are solutions to Legendre’s differential equation, which commonly arises in problems involving the physics of spherical symmetry, such as electrostatics or quantum mechanics. <dfn class="terminology">Bessel functions:</dfn> Bessel functions arise when solving differential equations that exhibit cylindrical symmetry, such as in problems involving heat conduction in cylindrical coordinates or wave propagation in circular structures. <dfn class="terminology">Hermite functions:</dfn> Hermite functions appear as solutions to Hermite’s differential equation, which frequently arises in quantum mechanics, specifically in problems related to harmonic oscillators. <dfn class="terminology">Hypergeometric functions:</dfn> Hypergeometric functions are solutions to the hypergeometric differential equation, which is a second-order linear differential equation. These functions have applications in various fields, including probability theory, mathematical physics, and number theory. <dfn class="terminology">Gamma and Beta functions:</dfn> The gamma and beta functions are defined as integrals and play a significant role in solving differential equations involving exponential or power functions. <dfn class="terminology">Airy functions:</dfn> Airy functions are solutions to Airy’s differential equation, which frequently arises in the study of wave phenomena, such as diffraction and interference.</div>
