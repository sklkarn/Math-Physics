  <introduction>
    <p>In order to describe a physical world we need a variety of physical quantities. 
      Any physical property which can be quantitized and measured in numbers is called a 
      physical quantity. The property such as 'anger, happiness, feelings, emotion, etc. 
      can not be quantitized and measured, hence they are not taken as physical quantities.  
      There are two types of physical quantities usually consider to describe a physical world. 
      They are a scalar quantity (or, simply  scalars) and a vector quantity (or, simply vectors)
      A scalar quantity has only magnitude (size)  e.g., mass, length, time, volume, density, 
      work, speed, temperature, potential, current, resistance, flux, power, intensity, etc. 
      A vector quantity has both magnitude and direction e.g., velocity, acceleration, displacement, 
      momentum, force, torque, impulse, moment, current density, etc. A quantity like surface 
      area is a scalar in general, but when considered with its specific orientation it is taken 
      as a vector. In physics, area is a vector quantity whose direction is always taken as 
      an outward normal to the surface. Normally, when area comes with any vectors in a mathematical 
      operation it is considered as a vector. For instance, flux is a dot product of two vectors, 
      one of them is an area. Mathematically, division of a vector with another vector is 
      undefined, hence pressure is considered as a scalar even if it is defined as a force per 
      unit area. To define pressure in general as a scalar we divide a magnitude of the 
      normal component of the force to the magnitude of the area. Actually, pressure has 
      more than one direction, hence it is a complex quantity which comes under tensors. 
      The concept of tensors are not made known in elementary courses.  A tensor is a vector 
      generalization of physical quantities. (We will discuss tensors later in this book.)</p>

      <p>
        A <term>vector</term> is represented by an arrow. The arrow shows the direction of 
        a vector and the length of the arrow represents the magnitude of that vector. 
        Points <m>O</m> and <m>P</m> of an arrow <m>OP</m> in <xref ref="fig-vectora"/> are known as 
        the initial point and the terminal point of the vector <m>\textbf{OP}</m>, respectively. 
        A vector is denoted by a letter with an arrow over it such as <m>\vec{OP} = \vec{a}</m> 
        and its magnitude is denoted by <m>\vec{|a|}</m> or simply by <m>a</m>. A vector of 
        unit magnitude is called a unit vector and is denoted by <m>\hat{a}</m>, ('a cap'), 
        Where <m>\hat{a}=\frac{\vec{a}}{\vec{|a|}}</m>, i.e., <m>\hat{a}</m> is a unit 
        vector of <m>\vec{a}</m>.

        A vector which specifies the position of point P with respect to its origin O is called 
        a position vector, as shown in  <xref ref="fig-vectora"/>. Let P and Q be two points and 
        O be the point of origin then the position vector of point P is <m>\vec{OP}</m> and that 
        of point Q is <m>\vec{OQ}</m>, as shown in  <xref ref="fig-vectorb"/>. A vector of zero 
        magnitude is a null vector. It is denoted by <m>\vec{O}</m>.  The initial and terminal 
        points coincide in case of a null vector. Thus it has no definite direction. 
        The vectors with same magnitude but in opposite direction are termed as negative vectors. 
        Vectors having the same direction are called like vectors, whereas those having opposite 
        directions are called  unlike vectors. The vectors parallel to the same line regardless 
        of their magnitudes and directions are  called collinear vectors. In  this case, there 
        exists a scalar <m> \lambda </m> such that <m>\vec{b} =\lambda \vec{a}</m> in the collinear 
        vectors <m>\vec{a}</m> and <m>\vec{b}</m>. The vectors whose directions are not parallel 
        to each other are non-collinear vectors. A system of vectors lying in the parallel planes 
        or in the same plane are called  coplanar vectors. The system of vectors which can not 
        lie in the same plane or parallel planes are called  non-coplanar vectors.
