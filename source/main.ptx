          To my spouse, who supported me through countless late nights and early mornings, 
          and never once complained.

          I would like to thank my colleagues and students for the contributions they have 
          made to improve this book through questionnaires, classroom discussion, and their 
          invaluable feedback and support throughout the writing process. I am especially 
          very grateful to John Gould, Keith Stafford, and Daniel Covington for 
          providing their critical suggestions to organize this book. Without their guidance, 
          this book would not be what it is today. Their knowledge and expertise were instrumental 
          in shaping my journey in writing this book. Finally, I want to express my gratitude to 
          my family for their unwavering encouragement and patience during the many long hours 
          I spent at my desk. Their love and support sustained me through the ups and downs 
          of this project. Several people deserve credit for their generous help with this book.

          Mathematical Physics is a branch of physics which provides the logical relationship 
          between physical theories and mathematical equations. It is based on the concept that 
          everything in nature follows mathematical rules and regulations. Many discoveries such 
          as the existance of positrons, the Higgs Boson, the concept that the gravity is a result 
          of warping of spacetime due to presence of mass, and spacetime obeyes fluid dynamics were 
          possible because of mathematical equations. This book attempts to provide preliminary 
          mathematical concepts to understand physical theories. This book has been written to 
          introduce basic mathematical tools that are useful in undergraduate physics courses 
          and is a concise form of my lecture notes which I have been delivering in bachelors 
          level classes for many years. It attempts to bridge physical theories to mathematical 
          equations. This book is organized into seven chapters that cover the syllabus of 
          mathematical physics at undergraduate level in variuos universities. The book consists of the basics 
          of vectors, vector space, matrix, tensors, Fourier series, integral transforms, 
          and the ordinary &amp; partial differential equations. The main objective of this 
          book is to guide students or readers to understand mathematical equations to learn physics. 
          Many examples and practice problems throughout the text may be helpful to refine physical 
          intution.
