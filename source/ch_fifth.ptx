  <title>Fourier Series</title>
   
  <introduction>
    <p>
    The Fourier series is a mathematical tool useful in representing a periodic 
    function as a sum of simple sine and cosine functions (harmonics). Any periodic 
    function with a well-defined period T can be expressed as an infinite sum of 
    sine and cosine functions with different frequencies. The frequencies are 
    integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, which is the reciprocal of 
    the period (1/T). A note from various musical instruments or other sources 
    are the complicated periodic function with the period of pure tone. 
    This complicated function may be expressed as a series of sines and cosines in the form of
    <me>
      f(x)= \frac{a_{o}}{2}+a_{1}\cos x + a_{2}\cos 2x + \cdots + a_{n}\cos nx + \cdots 
    </me>
    <me>
      + b_{1}\sin x +b_{2}\sin 2x + \cdots  + b_{n}\sin nx + \cdots.
    </me>
    
    <me>
	\therefore \quad  f(x) = \frac{a_{o}}{2} + \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\left[a_{n}\cos nx + b_{n}\sin nx\right].	
    </me>
    This infinite series is called Fourier series where <m>a_{o} {,}a_{1} {,} a_{2}  
    \cdots{,} a_{n} {,}\cdots {,} b_{1} {,} b_{2} {,} \cdots{,} b_{n}{,} \cdots, </m> etc. 
    are called Fourier coefficients.

        The Fourier series has numerous applications in various fields, including signal 
        processing, image compression, physics, engineering, and many areas of 
        applied mathematics. It provides a powerful tool for decomposing complex periodic 
        functions into simpler components and understanding their behavior.
