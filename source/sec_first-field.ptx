  <title>Field</title>
  <introduction>
       <p>
        A physical quantity which has one or more definite values at each point of a region of 
        space is said to be a point function in that region, and the region in which the physical 
        quantity is defined is called a field. There are two types of point functions, the scalar 
        point function and the vector point function. The physical quantities which are 
        non - directional can be expressed at each point of a region of space by a scalar point 
        function, <m>\phi</m>. For example, the density of a body and its temperature at any instant 
        of time are scalar point functions, and the region is called a scalar field. If the physical 
        quantities are directional then they can be expressed at each point of a region of space 
        by a vector point function, <m>\vec{V}</m>, e.g., the velocity of a moving fluid at 
        any instant, the distribution of electric or magnetic field intensity at a point of 
        space are vector point functions, and the region of this space is called a vector field. 
        If <m>\phi (x,y,z)</m> is a scalar function associated with every point <m>(x,y,z)</m> 
        of any region in space, then <m>\phi</m>  is called a scalar point function and the 
        region is defined as a scalar field. Again, if <m>\vec{V}(x,y,z)</m> is a vector 
        associated with every point <m>(x,y,z)</m> of any region in space, then <m>\vec{V}</m> 
        is called a vector point function and the region is defined as a vector field. 
        Remember, the gravitational field is a vector field which expresses the value of force, 
        and Higg's field is a scalar field which defines the mass or energy of a particle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Level Surfaces:</term> The portion of a scalar field upon which the scalar 
      function has a fixed value is called a level surface. Isothermal surfaces and 
      equipotential surfaces are examples of level surfaces for temperature and potential, 
      respectively.

    <title>Gradient of a Scalar Function</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
      The gradient of a scalar point function <m>\phi</m>  is defined as 
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{grad}\phi \amp =\hat{i}\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} + \hat{j}\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}

        \hat{j}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \hat{k}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)\phi = \vec{\nabla\phi}  </mrow>
      </md>
      where an operator <m>\nabla = \hat{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \hat{j}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} 
      + \hat{k}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}</m> 
      is known as <m>'Del'</m> operator and read as a gradient or a grad, which is a vector quantity.

    Let <m>S_{1}</m> and <m>S_{2}</m> be two level surfaces having scalar point functions <m>\phi</m> 
    and <m>\phi+\,d\phi</m> respectively. 
    The <m>\hat{n}</m> be an unit normal vector at point A and <m>dn</m> be the distance between 
    the surfaces <m>S_{1}</m>  and <m>S_{2}</m> along <m>\hat{n}</m>.  
  <men xml:id="eqn-delphi1">
    \therefore \,dn = \,dr \cos\theta = \hat{n}\cdot \vec{\,dr} 
  </men>
  where <m>\theta</m> is the angle between <m>\vec{AC}</m>  and <m>\vec{AB}</m>, 
  as shown in <xref ref="fig-delphi"/>. Due to  a small vector <m>\vec{dr}</m>  point B and C are very 
  close to each other. Hence the rate of change of <m>\phi</m> at point A in the direction of 
  <m>\hat{n}</m>  is  greatest and is equal to <m>\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial n}</m>, 
  and the total differential, 
  <men xml:id="eqn-delphi2">
    \,d\phi = \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial n} \,dn  = \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial n} \hat{n}\cdot \vec{\,dr}              
  </men>
  But, if <m>\phi (x,y,z)</m> be a function of three independent variables <m>(x,y,z)</m> 
  then its total differential <m>\,d\phi</m> is given by 
  <me>
    \,d \phi = \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x} dx + \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial y} dy 
    + \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial z} dz
  </me>
  <men xml:id="eqn-delphi3">
   \therefore \,d \phi = \left(\hat{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \hat{j}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} 
   + \hat{k}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)\phi \cdot \left(\hat{i}dx+ \hat{j}dy +\hat{k}dz\right) 
   = \vec{ \nabla \phi}\cdot \vec{d r} 
  </men> 

From equations <xref ref="eqn-delphi2"/> and <xref ref="eqn-delphi3"/>, we get -
<me>
  \vec{ \nabla \phi}\cdot \vec{d r} = \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial n} \hat{n}\cdot \vec{dr}
</me>
<men xml:id="eqn-delphi4">
  \therefore \quad \vec{ \nabla \phi} = \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial n} \hat{n} 
</men>
Hence the gradient of a scalar function <m>\phi</m> is defined as the maximum rate of change 
of <m>\phi</m> with respect to the space variables and has the direction of that change.
If <m>\vec{dr}</m> and <m>\vec{ \nabla \phi}</m>  are in the same direction then <m>d\phi
 = \mid\vec{ \nabla \phi}\mid\cdot \mid\vec{dr}\mid</m>
is maximum. If <m>\vec{dr}</m> lies on the surface <m>S_{1}</m>, then 
<m>\,d\phi = \vec{ \nabla \phi}\cdot\vec{dr} = 0</m>, which represents <m>\vec{dr}</m> 
and <m>\vec{ \nabla \phi}</m>  are perpendicular to each other, i.e., <m>\vec{dr}</m> 
lies along the direction of tangent on the given surface. Thus <m>\vec{\nabla \phi}</m>  
is normal to the surface of equation <m>\phi (x,y,z) = constant</m>.

  <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-dirderv">
    <title>Directional Derivative</title>
    <p>
      If <m>\phi (x,y,z)</m> be a scalar function at point <m>(x,y,z)</m> in space then 
      <m>\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x}</m> is the rate of change of <m>\phi</m> at <m>(x,yz)</m> 
      in the direction of <m>x</m>-axis and is called as the directional derivative of <m>\phi</m> 
      along <m>x- axis</m>. Similarly, <m>\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial y}</m>  and 
      <m>\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial z}</m> 
      are the directional derivative of <m>\phi</m> along <m>y</m>- and <m>z</m>-axes, respectively. 
      The directional derivative of <m>\phi</m>  at A along AB is defined as 
      <m>\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial r}</m> such that
    <me>
      \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial r} = \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial n} \frac{\partial n}{\partial r} 
       = \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial n} cos\theta   =  \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial n} \hat{n} \cdot\hat{a}

    </me>
    where <m>\hat{a}</m> is the unit vector along \textbf{AB}, as shown in <xref ref="fig-delphi"/>. 
    Hence the directional derivative of function <m>\phi</m> along the given direction is the 
    projection of a gradient of that function along this direction, i.e., 
    <me>
      \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial r}  = \text{projection of}\quad \vec{ \nabla \phi}\quad \text{along}\quad \hat{a}.

      Let <m>\vec{v}=v_{1}\hat{i}+v_{2}\hat{j}+v_{3}\hat{k}</m> be the velocity of fluid at  
      point P <m>(x,y,z)</m>. If P be the centre of an  elementary parallelopiped considering 
       in the moving fluid and <m>\,dx, \,dy, \,dz</m> are the  edges of such element, 
       then  the  x- component of velocity at point P = <m>v_{x} (x,y,z)</m>, as shown in figure.  
       The x- component of velocity at the middle of the face ABCD  = <m>v_{x} (x-\frac{dx}{2},y,z)</m>
       <me>
        = v_{x} (x,y,z)-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial x} dx 
       </me>
       [using Taylor's series, <m>f(x+dx) = f(x)+f'(x)dx+ f"(x)/2 (dx)^{2} +\cdots </m>] </p>
       <p>
       Similarly, x- component of velocity at the middle of face EFGH
       <me>
        =v_{x} (x+\frac{dx}{2},y,z)	
         = v_{x}(x,y,z) + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial x} dx.
       </me>
       
       Since the parallelopiped is very small, the value at the middle of face is considered 
       as the average  over that face. The volume of fluid entering per unit time through the face ABCD
      =velocity <m>\times</m> area of the face
      <me>
        =\left( v_{x} - \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial x} dx\right) dy dz 
      </me>
      <me>
        [\because  \frac{volume}{time} = \frac{area\cdot length}{time} = velocity\cdot area]
      </me>
      and volume of fluid leaving per unit time through face EFGH 
      <me>
        =\left( v_{x} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial x} dx\right) dy dz. 
      </me>
      Therefore, loss in volume of fluid per unit time along x- axis 
      <me>
        =\left( v_{x} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial x} dx\right) dy dz - \left( v_{x} - \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial x} dx\right) dy dz = \frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial x} dx dy dz 
      </me>
Similarly, losses in volume per unit time along y- and z- axes, respectively are
<me>
  \frac{\partial v_{y}}{\partial y}dx dy dz \hspace{5pt}\text{and} \hspace{5pt} \frac{\partial v_{z}}{\partial z}dx dy dz. 
</me>
Hence, total loss in volume per unit time = <m>\frac{\,dV}{\,dt}</m>
<me>
  = \left(\frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial v_{y}}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial v_{z}}{\partial z}\right)dx dy dz 
</me>
or,  total loss in volume per unit time per unit volume = <m>\frac{1}{\,dV}\frac{\,dV}{\,dt}</m>  
<me>
  =\left(\frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial v_{y}}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial v_{z}}{\partial z}\right)  
</me>
<me>
  =\left(\hat{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+\hat{j}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+\hat{k}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)\cdot \left(v_{x}\hat{i}+v_{y}\hat{j}+v_{z}\hat{k}\right) = \vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{v} =  div \vec{v}
</me>
The divergence of a vector field at a point gives the rate at which the fluid is diverging 
from that point per unit volume. If div <m>\vec{v}</m> is positive at a point, then either 
the fluid is expanding and its density at that point is decreasing with time, 
or the point is a source of the fluid. If div <m>\vec{v}</m> is negative, 
then either the fluid is condensing and its density is increasing at that point, 
or the point is a sink. If the fluid is incompressible, then there is no loss or 
gain in volume. </p>
<p>
  Hence, div <m>\vec{v} =0</m>, and <m>\vec{v}</m> is called a solenoidal vector function.

    Consider a small rectangular plane area in a region of a non-lamellar vector field. 
    A field is called a <term>non-lamellar</term> if its line integral around a cloased path is non-zero. 
    When the rectangular area is placed in the position ABCD, i.e. perpendicular  to  the vector  
    field <m>\vec{v}</m> as shown in <xref ref="fig-fig14a"/>, then the field is normal to  each  side of  the  
    rectangle and  hence the line integral  along  all  sides is zero. In  the position of 
    <m>A_{o}B_{o}C_{o}D_{o}</m>, rectangle is parallel to the field and the line integrals along 
    <m>B_{o}C_{o}</m> and <m>D_{o}A_{o}</m>  are zero while that along <m>A_{o}B_{o}</m> and 
    <m>C_{o}D_{o}</m> have finite  values. Thus the line integral around the boundary of the 
    rectangle has a finite value. The value of a vector field along the upper and lower 
    edges is assumed to be different in non-lamellar vector fields, the value of the line 
    integral around a closed path depends upon the orientation of the small area considered 
    in the region of the vector field. There is a certain orientation of the plane area for 
    which the line integral of the vector field is maximum. This maximum line integral when 
    computed for unit area is called the curl of the vector field. It is a vector quantity 
    directed along the normal to the exploring area. The normal is determined by the right-hand 
    screw rule. Actually, curl is a measurement of the circulation of vector field around a point. 
    If a component of vector field is tangentail to the contour, then the curl will be positive; 
    if the component is opposite to the tangential direction of the contour, then the curl will be 
    negative; and curl is zero at the center point of contour.

If P be the center of a test area as shown in <xref ref="fig-fig14b"/> and <m>\,dx</m> and <m>\,dy</m>

Since the test area is so small that the value of field at the middle of side is taken as an average along that side.
Therefore, the line integral of field along <m>ab</m> and <m>cd</m>
<me>

  When the rectangle is placed in zx plane and yz plane then the line integral per unit area obtained will be
