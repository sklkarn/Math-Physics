  <title>Rank of a Tensor</title>
  <introduction>
   <p>
    The rank (order) of a tensor is the number of indices in the symbol representing a tensor. 
    For example: <m>A</m> is a tensor of rank zero (scalar), <m>B^{i}</m> is a contravarient 
    tensor of rank one (vector), <m>C_{k}</m> is a covarient tensor of rank one (vector), 
    <m>D_{ij}</m> is a covarient tensor of rank two (dyadic), 
    <m>M^{p q r}</m>	is a contravarient tensor of rank three (triadic), 
    and	<m>T_{kl.....}^{ij....}</m> is a mixed tensor of rank four. 
    </p>
   <p>
    In an <m>n</m>- dimensional space, the number of components of a tensor of rank <m>r</m> is <m>n^{r}</m>. 
    For example: A scalar has one component (magnitude only) and hence zero basis vector per component. 
    A vector has two components (magnitude and one direction) in <m>2D</m> and hence has 1 basis vector 
    per component. A vector has 3 components (magnitude and one direction) in 3D and hence has 1 basis 
    vector per component. A tensor of rank 2 (dyad) has <m>3^{2} = 9</m> components 
    (magnitude and two directions) in 3D hence has 2 basis vectors per component. 
    A tensor of rank 3 (triad) has <m>3^{3} = 27</m> components (magnitude and three directions) 
    in 3D hence has 3 basis vectors per component and so on.

  <title>Contravarient and Covarient Tensors</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Covariance and contravariance describe how the quantitative description of physical entities 
      change with a change of basis. A covariant tensor is one that transforms in the same way 
      as the coordinate system itself. This means that the components of the tensor change in a 
      particular way when the coordinates of the system are changed. A contravariant tensor, 
      on the other hand, transforms in the opposite way to the coordinate system. 
      This means that the components of the tensor change in a particular way when the coordinates 
      of the system are changed. For a contravariant vector to be basis independent, 
      the components of the vector must contra-vary 
      (opposite manner) with a change of basis to compensate. That is, the components must vary with 
      the inverse transformation to that of the change of basis. These componets of vectors are said 
      to be contravariant. Examples of vectors with contravariant componets include the position of 
      an object (displacement) relative to an observer, or any derivative of position with respect 
      to time including velocity, acceleration, and jerk. For a covariant vector to be basis-independent, 
      the components of the vector must co-vary (same manner) with change of basis to remain representing 
      the same vector. That is, the componets must vary by the same transformation as the change of basis. 
      The componets of these vectors are said to be covariant. Examples of covariant vectors apear when 
      taking a gradiant of a function.

          <p>
            <term>Note:</term> The contravarient tensor is represented by components in the directions 
          of coordinate increase whereas a covarient tensor is represented by components in the directions 
          orthogonal to constant coordinate surfaces. In case of a cartesian coordinate system, the 
          coordinate direction <m>x^{i}</m> concides with the direction orthogonal to the constant 
          <m>x^{i}</m> surface so that the direction between the covarient and contravarient tensors 
          vanishes. Hence we can not distinguish between them in cartesian systems. 
          The covariance or contravariance of the tensor components is not intrinsic property of the 
          entity but this distinction is due to the way in which the entity is related to coordinate 
          system to which it is referred. It is to be noted that in a cartesian system
          <me>
            \frac{\partial x^{j}}{\partial \bar{x}^{i}}= \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{i}}{\partial x^{j}}.
          </me>
          That is, both these partial derivatives are equal to the direction cosines between 
          <m>\bar{x}^{i}</m> - and  <m>x^{i}</m> - axes. Hence there is no difference between 
          contravariant and covariant transformations in cartesian coordinates. In other coordinate 
          system this is not true in general, thus the difference in covariant and contravariant is observed. 
            </p>
          <p>
            The tensor whose components transform like coordinate differential are called contravariant tensors. In this expression 
            <me>
              \bar{A}^{i} = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{3}\frac{\partial \bar{x}^{i}}{\partial x^{j}}{A}^{j};
            </me>
            where <m>\frac{\partial \bar{x}^{i}}{\partial x^{j}}</m> are the coordinate differentials. For example:
            <ol>
              <li>
                In cartesian coordinates <m>(x,y)</m>, suppose the velocity components are 
                <m>\dot{x}=\frac{\,dx}{\,dt}</m>, <m>\dot{y}=\frac{dy}{dt}</m>;
              </li>
              <li>
                 In oblique coordinats <m>(\alpha{,}\beta)</m> the velocity components are 
                 <m>\dot{\alpha}=\frac{\,d \alpha}{\,dt}</m>, <m>\dot{\beta}=\frac{\,d \beta}{\,dt}</m>; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  In polar coordinates <m>(r, \theta)</m>, the velocity components are 
                  <m>\dot{r}=\frac{\,dr}{\,dt}</m>, <m>\dot{\theta}=\frac{\,d\theta}{\,dt}</m>.
                  </li>
            </ol>
Since all these relations express the velocity of same particle, they are related to each other in the following way:
<me>
  \frac{\,d\alpha}{\,dt} = \frac{\,d\alpha}{\,dx} \frac{\,dx}{\,dt} + \frac{\,d\alpha}{\,dy}\frac{\,dy}{\,dt}
</me>
or,
<me>
  \dot{\alpha} = \frac{\,d\alpha}{\,dx} \dot{x}  + \frac{\,d\alpha}{\,dy} \dot{y}
</me>
also,
<me>
  \dot{\beta} = \frac{\,d\beta}{\,dx}\dot{x}  + \frac{\,d\beta}{\,dy} \dot{y}
</me>
Now,
<me>
  \dot{r} = \frac{\,dr}{\,dx} \dot{x}  + \frac{\,dr}{\,dy}\dot{y}
</me>
and,
<me>
  \dot{\theta} = \frac{\,d\theta}{\,dx}\dot{x}  + \frac{\,d\theta}{\,dy} \dot{y}
</me>
or,
<me>
  \bar{v}^{i} = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{3}\frac{\partial \bar{x}^{i}}{\partial x^{j}}{v}^{j}	
</me>
The components transforming like this equation are known as the contravariant tensor components of 
a vector and are characterised by coordinates differential transformation or transforms like the 
coordinate differentials. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The tensor whose components transform like the partial derivatives of the coordinate are 
              called covariant tensors. In the expression
              <me>
                \bar{A}_{j} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}\frac{\partial x^{i}}{\partial \bar{x}^{j}}{A}_{i};

              If <m>\psi</m> expresses a velocity function, then the components of velocity in

              and

              </me>
              The components which transform like this equation are called the covariant tensor components 
              of a vector because the transformation is characterised by the partial derivatives of the 
              coordinates or transforms like the derivatives of a scalar.

      In coordinate transformation, vectors remains the same but its components change. 
      Suppose we have two types of cartesian coordinates where the basis vectors are 
      related as <m>\hat{i'}=2\hat{i}</m> and <m>\hat{j'}=\hat{j}</m>, then <m>x'= x/2</m> 
      and <m> y'= y </m>. For example, consider a  vector <m>\vec{a} = 4\hat{i}+ 3\hat{j}</m> 
      in unprimed system then <m>\vec{a} = 2\hat{i'}+ 3\hat{j'}</m> in the primed system, 
      meaning if basis vectors increase the components decrease. Such type of transformation 
      is called the contravariant transformation. Displacement, velocity, acceleration, etc. 
      obey such type of  transformation. Now consider a gradiant of scalar function 
      <me>
        \vec{\nabla \psi} = \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}\hat{i} +\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y}\hat{j}.
      </me>
      Gradiant of a scalar function is a vector which represents the magnitude of maximum rate 
      of change of the function. In previous case for a vector if <m>\hat{i'}=2\hat{i}</m> 
      then it's component <m>x'= x/2</m> and hence the component of the gradiant 
      <me>
        \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x'}(\hat{i'}) 
        = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}(\hat{2i}) 
        = \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}(\hat{i}).
      </me>
       Here as basis vector increses component also has to increase by the same fasion 
       otherwise the maximum rate of sclar changes differently in different coordinate systems. 
       Such system where component increases as basis vector increases is called a covariant vector.

    A tensor whose two contravariant or covariant indices can be interchanged without 
    affecting the value of the tensor, then it is called symmetric tensor in these indices. 
    If <m>A^{ij} = A^{ji}</m> then the tensor is symmetric contravariant tensor in the

    The same is true for covariant tensor <idx><h>covariant tensor</h></idx>.
