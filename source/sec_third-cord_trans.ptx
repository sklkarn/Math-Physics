  <title>Tensor Algebra</title>
  <introduction>
   <p>
    Like vector algebra, tensor also obeys the laws of algebra.
   ,<ol>
    <li>
      <term>Addition:</term> when two similar tensors are added the third tensor of same type 
      will yield.
       <me>A_{q}^{mp} + B_{q}^{mp} = C_{q}^{mp}</me>
    </li>
    <li>
      <term>Multiplication (outer product or direct product):</term> when two tensors of 
      any rank will be multiplied as outer product the third tensor has the rank multiple 
      of their ranks. such as <m>A_{q}^{pr} \bigotimes B_{s}^{m} = C_{qs}^{prm}</m>. The 
      result of the direct product is a tensor whose rank is the sum of the ranks of the 
      tensors being multiplied. <em>The division of a tensor of rank greater than zero by 
      another tensor of rank greater than zero is not defined</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <term>Contraction:</term> The process of reducing the number of indices of a mixed 
        tensor by one. for example: to contract the components of <m>A_{klm}^{ij}</m> into 
        <m>B_{lm}^{j}</m> we have to set <m>i=j</m>, then <m>A_{klm}^{ij}= B_{lm}^{j}</m>, 
        	again, if <m>j=l</m>, then <m>B_{lm}^{j} = C_{m}</m>, a tensor of rank one.
        </li>
        <li>
          <term>Inner multiplication:</term> The inner product between two tensors results 
          from first forming the direct product, and then setting the two nearest indices 
          (with one index coming from each tensor) equal to one another and performing the 
          sum according to the summation convention, e.g. If we multiply <m>A_{q}^{mp}</m> and 
          <m>B_{st}^{r}</m> then the outer product is <m>A_{q}^{mp}B_{st}^{r}</m>. 
          Now set <m>q=r</m> we get the inner product as <m>A_{r}^{mp}B_{st}^{r}</m>, 
          again if <m>q=r</m> and <m>p=s</m>, then another inner product 
          <m>A_{r}^{mp}B_{pt}^{r}</m> is obtained. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <term>Quotient Law:</term>  This law is useful to determine whether the given 
            quantity is a tensor or not. Suppose it is not known whether X is a tensor 
            or not but its inner product with an arbitrary tensor is a tensor then X itself 
            is also a tensor. This is called a quotient law. The quotient rule can generally 
            be written as <m>KA = B</m> where <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are tensors of known rank 
            and <m>K</m> is an unknown quantity. The quotient rule gives the rank of <m>K</m>, 
            e.g., in <m> \vec{L}=I\vec{\omega}</m>, where <m> \vec{l}</m> and 
            <m>\vec{\omega}</m> are known vectors, then from quotient rule we come to know 
            that <m>I</m> is a second rank tensor. Some well know quotient rules are

  <title>Dummy Suffix</title>
  <p>
  If suffix <m>i</m> occurs twice in a term, then that suffix <m>i</m> is called dummy suffix. 
  For example, <m>i</m> is a dummy suffix in <m>a_{ij}x_{i}</m>. Also a dummy suffix can be 
  replace by another dummy suffix i.e., <m>a_{ij}x_{i}\equiv a_{kj}x_{k}</m>.

    in curvilinear coordinates. we define the line element $ds$ in the <m>n</m>- dimensional 
    space to be given by the quadratic form called metric. The quantities <m>g_{pq}</m> are 
    called metric coefficients and are symmetric, i.e., <m>g_{pq} = g_{qp}</m>. If 
    <m>g_{pq} = 0</m> and <m>p \neq q</m>, then the coordinate system is orthogonal. In this 
    case <m>g_{11} = h_{1}^{2}{,} g_{22} = h_{2}^{2} {,} g_{33} = h_{3}^{2}</m>. 
    The generalized form of element of length <m>\,ds</m> between the points <m>x^{i}</m> and 
    <m>x^{i} + \,dx^{i}</m> is given by <m>\,ds^{2}=g_{ij}\,dx^{i}\,dx^{j}</m>,
