  <title>Integral Transform</title>
   
  <introduction>
  <p>
    An integral transform is a mathematical operation that transforms a function 
    into another function through the use of an integral. It is a tool used to 
    solve differential equations and some analyze functions. There are several important 
    integral transforms, each with its own properties and applications. Some of the commonly 
    used integral transforms include: 
    <term>Laplace Transform:</term> The Laplace transform converts a function of time 
    into a function of a complex variable. It is particularly useful for solving ordinary 
    and partial differential equations, analyzing linear time-invariant systems, 
    and studying transient behavior. <term>Fourier Transform: </term> The Fourier transform 
    converts a function of time into a function of frequency. It decomposes a function 
    into its constituent frequency components and is extensively used in signal processing, 
    image processing, and various other fields. There are various transforms used in practice 
    for various purposes.

    The solution of differential equations with boundary value can easily be determined with 
    the help of integral transforms. The integral transform <m>F(s)</m> of a function 
    <m>f(x)</m> is defined as 
    <me>
      \mathscr{F}\{f(x)\}=F(s) = \int\limits_{a}^{b}f(x)k(s,x)\,dx
    </me>
   where <m>k(s,x)</m> is called a kernal of the function. For example,

              <me>
                \mathscr{F}\{f(x)\}=F(s) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x) e^{-isx}\,dx
